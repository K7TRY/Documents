The Kentucky State Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court have both ruled that checkpoints that are operated with the general interest in crime control and not a specific aim that they have approved is a violation of civil rights. Because this is a well established violation of rights, qualified immunity does not protect individual law enforcement personnel from being sued personally under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Madison County Sheriff's Office policy 24.3 (Revised 1/2021) item 18 states, "Any apparent or suspected violation of a traffic or criminal law may also be investigated and enforced."

Caselaw clearly prohibits stopping people without probable cause to look for any criminal violation. That is a violation of the Forth Amendment. Below are caselaw quotes and links to binding caselaw that law enforcement are held accountable to.

`"The presence of the drug dog at a roadblock held in the mid-afternoon operated by only one officer trained to detect drunk drivers, coupled with the testimony of Deputy Morris that the purpose of the roadblock was "to detect any violation of the law," indicates that the primary purpose of the roadblock was general crime control, or more specifically, the interdiction of illegal narcotics. The United States Supreme Court has proscribed this purpose in Edmond and we are bound by that decision."`

`"Held: Because the checkpoint program's primary purpose is indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violate the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 37-48."`

The policy of the MCSO shows a "pattern and practice" of conducting illegal checkpoints. This exposes the department to a 34 U.S.C. § 12601 violation.

`§12601. Cause of action`  
`(a) Unlawful conduct`  
`It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.`

An example of an additional violation of the 4th Amendment can be found on the "Call for service" form "Incident: 202200022801" at :21:59:41 when "mcd0082 - JENNIFER SLAGLI" searched for information on a seized firearm serial number.

I do not know the circumstances of this search and seizure, but it is suspicious. A firearm is not a traffic violation. And searching for information on a firearm serial number without probable cause is an unreasonable search and seizure. Searching for information about a firearm serial number extended the stop at the checkpoint. That could be a violation of RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATES.

Even if running the serial number is not an unreasonable search and seizure, it proves that "the checkpoint program's primary purpose is indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control".

Is it legal to extend a checkpoint stop to run a warrant check without probable cause?

Is it legal to extend a checkpoint stop to run a firearm serial number through a government database?
