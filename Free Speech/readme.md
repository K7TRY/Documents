I am writing to complain about the “MADISON COUNTY FISCAL COURT RESOLUTION 2024-94” as it violates the freedom of speech guaranteed to all Kentuckians in the laws of The Commonwealth of Kentucky and The United States of America.
Kentucky law protects citizen's right to "freely communicat[e] their thoughts and opinions." and to "applying to those invested with the power of government for redress of grievances". Citizens have an enormous first amendment interest in directing speech about public issues to those who govern their county. Our form of government cannot work without feedback from the people.
This resolution threatens violence against people who are exercising their free speech rights in a limited public forum with their elected representatives. That is indefensible. 
In this resolution The Madison County Fiscal Court claims that because the open records statute does not forbid them from limiting speech, they may limit speech. That argument ignores all other sections of the laws of The Commonwealth of Kentucky and The United States of America that protect free speech. This argument is clearly wrong. We cannot look at the law with blinders on. We are obligated to follow the whole law. I expect better reasoning from Judge Executives.
I am sure that the open records statute does not forbid battery, rape, and murder. But are you legally allowed to do those things in a government meeting. No. God forbid.
